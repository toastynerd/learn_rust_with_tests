# Learn Rust with Tests
Attempting to make a book similar to [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests) but for Rust.
Considering I don't know Rust this is probably going to take a while.

Creating this with [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) to see a local running version run `mdbook serve`.

Example code will be under the src director then in a folder with the name of the chapter, ex `01-hello-world` will contain
the example code for the frist chapter.

Everything in here is subject to change as I go through this project.
