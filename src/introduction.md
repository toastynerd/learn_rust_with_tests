# Introduction
Welcome to "Learn Rust with Tests". I wanted a book similar to [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests) but for Rust.
Turns out such a book doesn't exist so I'm attempting to write it. I don't know 
Rust so this is probably going to take a while. The concepts and chapter structure
will be loosely based on [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) with some hopefully obvious
changes. First, we start with testing from the get go. 
To learn Rust with tests, you need to write tests, duh. I will also probably
spend a little more time explaning things than rust by example does. Partly
to padd the word count and partly to make sure that I understand what the heck
is going on in my own book. 

I'm not going to outline conventions for the book just yet because I don't
what they are yet. I'm using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) to
write this because it seems like the standard for books about rust. I'm assuming
the reader has at least some experience with TDD so I won't be justifying it
as a practice or rehashing what red/green/refactor is. Most likely if you're reading
a book with "tests" in the title you're already familiar with what they are and
why they're important. I'll try to include my reasoning for using certain strategies
but unless someone wants to help on this project I'm limited by own knowledge as are we all.
If you see room for improvement just let me know. For now, this is going to live here: https://github.com/toastynerd/learn_rust_with_tests

With all that said, let's get after some (hopefully) well tested code!
